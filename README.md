# Mental Fitness Tracker

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the percentage of people with mental disorders in a country based on various features such as the prevalence of specific mental disorders (Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Eating Disorder, Anxiety), drug usage, depression, alcohol use, and mental fitness. By analyzing these factors, we aim to provide insights into the mental health landscape of different countries and predict the mental fitness percentage accurately.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate the percentage of people with mental disorders in various countries based on factors such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Eating Disorder, Anxiety, drug usage, depression, alcohol use, and mental fitness. 
By analyzing historical data and employing regression and machine learning algorithms, the model will offer insights into mental health trends and provide valuable information for governments, healthcare organizations, and researchers. The project's value proposition lies in informed decision-making, targeted interventions, early detection, and promotion of mental health awareness. With a user-friendly interface, the model can be used to make real-time predictions, contributing to a more supportive and resilient global mental health landscape.

## Deployment

To run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
  First Clone the repository
  Once Cloned open the jupyter notebook and.
  Press ALT+ENTER to run a cell.
  To run the complete notebook goto cells and then run all.
```


## Modelling
Our predictive model involved two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
The success of this project will be measured based on the metrics like Mean Squared Error(MSE), R2 Score, etc. between the predicted mental fitness percentage and the actual percentage.
Upon successful deployment, the model can be utilized by the end users mentioned earlier to gain insights into mental health trends, identify areas that require attention, and take proactive measures to improve mental health on a national level. The project's ultimate value proposition lies in contributing to a healthier and more supportive global mental health landscape.
